Welcome to Ympker's multi-purpose server kit for Debian/Ubuntu based systems. This kit is a collection of scripts that will help you managing common tasks of your Debian/Ubuntu Server. It has been inspired by lots of cool projects from awesome-selfhosted etc..

IMPORTANT:

This script is heavily dependant on other projects as it will just clone and execute them for the most part. This means, if a problem occurs your best bet is to check out the respective Github source (displayed prior to installing). I take NO RESPONSIBILITY for the accuracy, functionality and integrity of this Kit, nor for any harm that is caused by it or any of the linked scripts. YOU alone will be responsible when using this script!

Usage instructions:

wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NicolasLoew/Ympkit/master/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
sh setup.sh
